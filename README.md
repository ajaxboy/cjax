Please do note that I do offer profesional installation, should you need that service.



## Introduction

Cjax is a small lightweight but very powerful Ajax Framework that translate PHP Code into User Interface Actions. It can 
help to develop Ajax applications in record time, saving you up to 60% of development time once you are familiar with the
simple to use Cjax API.
  
Cjax is simplistic and uses Convention  Over Configuration model approach. With its MVC design makes it quite easy to integrate
into existing PHP-Frameworks (such as Zend, CodeIgnater, cakePHP, Yii, etc). However it does not require a framework, it can very well work on itself, on any site.

In most cases all you need is one line of code. Cjax carries a plugin system (as well as the core) that makes PHP and JavaScript look like lovers, meaning that
it is the most seemless integration of PHP and JavaScript that you can find.

Unlike others libraries that try to mimic Cjax, for cjax there is no 'client' side involved, there is no inlines codes, there is no process request, all you need is your php code and that's it.
 

##Background##

Cjax allows you to write ajax in the PHP side, it gives you many tools that you can use to make your deveploment experience a smooth ride. It also saves you tons of time from re-inventing the wheel, - you see, I spent years perfecting this tool, now you can just come and use and not spend all that time - and money! - not to mention the research, gone overboard.

Cjax comes with over 70 examples/samples/docs and APIs that can let you do amazing things with a single line of code, that otherwise would take you hours or days, or even weeks!. You know, the usual success message, to lightbox, submitting forms with ajax, and uploading files with ajax, you know - the usual stuff that you would use in your application or website, each one of these things I just mentioned took me days and weeks to code, and overtime they have improved, Cjax has become an e-cosystem of ajax functions.

Cjax consolidates all your ajax code in a single place. Making your code more secure. Cjax also has only one point of access. Making your application or website very secure. Cjax lets you use classes and routes your ajax calls through a dispatcher to reach your ajax controller. Includes a callback system, that lets you do ajax requests when the page loads, but also, when you trigger your ajax request once on the server, it lets you run more ajax code, and interact with your application or website right from the back-end, right from your controller. This gives you the freedom to go back and forth, from one ajax method to the other, working in harmony. Also includes a way that you can maninupate all the elements on the page, right from the back-end, all done within one ajax call.

Cjax is a piece of machinery to build ajax features . Uses unconventional methods to push the bounderies in allowing you to just write very few short lines of code .

Cjax has the power to allow you to to call and use your existing JavaScript, without making changes to it. It really lets express yourself in the way that you want to express. You have old, or new custom JavaScript, execute it with Cjax - you can pass data to your existing functions, instanciate them, right from the back-end. You use other 3rd party libraries or code - no problem. Cjax lets you execute it, and pass data to it, right from the back-end, you can call them as many times as you want, no limit, only the sky. You can pass from simple strings, or integers, to entire arrays or objects. Guess what, As a matter of fact, that is what Cjax's plugins are, 'plugins' is just a formality, but what they really are - custom code ran with Cjax. If you run your custom code, you already built a Cjax plugin!

Cjax code is simple easy to understand, and uses convention over configuration approach to do the most, with less.



## Examples, more Examples, the CJax's way, one line of php code does it all

### Example #1 - Ajax Call

Self explanatory really, $ajax, element_id .. call.. ajax controller umm need I say more?.

```php
<?php
$ajax->click('#element_id' , $ajax->call('controller/method'));
?>
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<?php echo $ajax->init();?>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a id='element_id' href='#'>Click me</a>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Example #2 - Ajax Form

What I love about Cjax, that you take a look a that line of code, and you know exactly what it is doing, even if you didn't know PHP. On this example,  #form_anchor is the element id. You can assign an ajax form to it through the $ajax object, and boom you got an ajax form, you can really assign the form to anything on the page with an id, and when you click it, it submits the form through ajax, to the specified ajax controller, and yes you can even upload files!.

```php
<?php
$ajax->form_anchor = $ajax->form('controller/method');
?>
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<?php echo $ajax->init();?>
	</head>
	<body>
	<form>
		Field #1 <input type='text' id='field1' name='field1' />
		<br />
		Field #2 <input type='text' id='field1' name='field2' />
		<br />
		<a id='form_anchor' href='#'>Click me To Submit Form</a>
	</form>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Example #3 - Ajax Overlay, Lightbox

What this line of code does?  It add a click event to element #anchor, when you click this anchor it will trigger an ajax request and load external html from a file or a controller. It will display a lightbox (a new window) displaying the contents gathered from the controller.  All this , with one line of code,  beat that!.

```php
<?php
$ajax->click('#anchor' , $ajax->overlay('controller/splashHTML'));
?>
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<?php echo $ajax->init();?>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a id='anchor' href='#'>Click Show Overlay</a>
	</body>
</html>
```



### Example #4 - Get Json Object with Cjax

In this example, we introduce you to Ajax Controllers. An ajax controller is php file dedicated to serving ajax requests for any purposer on your application or website. In fact the entire directory is dedicated to ajax requests. To reach this ajax controller, you go through a dispatcher file called ajax.php. The dispatcher will route your request to the controller.

To get a json object, simply return an array from your ajax method.

```php
<?php
$ajax->click('#anchor_id' , $ajax->call(array('JsoncController','JsonData')));
?>
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<?php echo $ajax->init();?>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a id='anchor_id' href='#'>Click to get Jason object</a>
	</body>
</html>


File:  controllers/JsonData.php

Class JsoncController {
	
	public function JsonData() {
	
		return $_SERVER;;
	}
	
}


```

### Q/A For critics:

#### Does cjax add a bunch of code/footprint to my page?
No!, absolutely no!. Cjax works with PHP Sessions, it saves a variable to keep track of your ajax actions. This variable in array format, is converted into an xml string, this string is processed by Cjax's engine, once interpreted it serves the desired functionality, cjax uses the best methods to interact with the DOM elements, it doesn't require any code on the page. There is absolutely zero code printed on the page!, and that is why Cjax is the fastest!.

#### Is Cjax in competition with jQuery?
A few people have asked this question, there is a large explation for it. 
But I will sumarize in a brief. 

Cjax is not a replacement for Jquery. Cjax offers plenty of features besides allowing you to use wildcard selectors
and ajax requests. Cjax offers a powerful MVC system to power up the backend of your application using ajax. Jquery will do so
in the front end. In some cases Cjax uses jquery to quickly produce tools (plugins) that are powerful
in both backend and front-end.
